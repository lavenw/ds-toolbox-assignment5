Definition: git status

The git status command is incredibly useful for understanding the current state of your Git repository. When you run git status, Git provides you with information about:

Modified files: It shows which files have been modified since the last commit. This helps you keep track of changes you've made locally.
Staged files: It indicates which changes have been staged (added to the index) and are ready to be committed.
Untracked files: It lists any files in your working directory that are not yet tracked by Git. These are typically new files that you haven't added to the repository yet.
Branch information: It also displays the current branch you're on and whether your branch is ahead or behind its remote counterpart.
